# Predicting Wine Quality
Predicting Wine Quality was selected to determine if a vineyard that is interested in a new business venture in the wine industry would be successful, based upon characteristics their wine possesses.

 ## Questions the data will potentially answer using Machine Learning:
1.     Will the wine produced at the vineyard have high quality scores and be successful?
2.     If wine characteristics are altered, will this impact the algorithm and not produce target quality scores?







# Technology
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and SQL will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask or Tableau to display the data.
## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using for training and testing our source data and to create a linear/non-linear regression model. 
## Dashboard
For our dashboard, weâ€™ll utilize Tableau to build a fully functioning, interactive dashboard. 






















# Mock Up of Database/ERD



#Sample of Dataset 


# Project Flow Chart
Our project flow chart includes the mock up of our Machine Learning Model.

# Outline of Final Dashboard
We plan to build our dashboard within Tableau and anticipate it will include the following elements:
Bar chart to display the top quality score wines.
Column chart to compare wine quality scores.
Pie chart to display the percentages of the categories, such as alcohol content, residual sugar, etc. of the wines with the highest quality scores and how they are distributed.
The average quality score for our wine.
This is our initial outline of our dashboard and will progressively elaborate as we analyze our data and outcomes of our analysis.

## Outline of Project

### Team Members
- Danielle Myrick
- Delana Vath
- Jeff Purvis

### Communication Protocols for Project
We established that our group will communicate via class times, Slack, text, and ad hoc phone and video calls.

### Overview of Project
JDD Vineyards, a new business venture, has hired Myrick, Purvis, & Vath Consulting for their "Predicting Wine Quality" project. JDD Vineyards wants the consulting team to determine if their vineyard would produce quality wines, based upon characteristics their wines possess. The consulting team will analyze a dataset with quality scores and use Machine Learning to predict the quality scores JDD Vineyards would receive.

#### Questions the data will potentially answer using Machine Learning
Will the wines produced at the vineyard have high quality scores and be successful?

### Data Source
The data was sourced from Kaggle, and the specific links/files can be obtained below:

# Technology

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and SQL will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask or Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using for training and testing our source data and to create a linear/non-linear regression model. 

## Dashboard
For our dashboard, weâ€™ll utilize Tableau to build a fully functioning, interactive dashboard.

# Outline of Final Dashboard
We plan to build our dashboard within Tableau and anticipate it will include the following elements:

- Bar chart to display the top quality score wines.
- Column chart to compare wine quality scores.
- Pie chart to display the percentages of the categories, such as alcohol content, residual sugar, etc. of the wines with the highest quality scores and how they are distributed.
- The average quality score for our wine.

This is our initial outline of our dashboard and will progressively elaborate as we analyze our data and outcomes of our analysis.

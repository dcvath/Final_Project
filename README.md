## Outline of Project

### Team Members
- Danielle Myrick
- Delana Vath
- Jeff Purvis

### Communication Protocols for Project
We established that our group will communicate via class times, Slack, text, and ad hoc phone and video calls.

### Overview of Project
JDD Vineyards, a new business venture, has hired Myrick, Purvis, & Vath Consulting for their "Predicting Wine Quality" project. JDD Vineyards wants the consulting team to determine if their vineyard would produce quality wines, based upon characteristics their wines possess. The consulting team will analyze a dataset with quality scores and use Machine Learning to predict the quality scores JDD Vineyards would receive.

#### Question the data will potentially answer using Machine Learning Technology
Will the wines produced at JDD Vineyards generate high quality scores and be successful?

### Data Source
The data was sourced from Kaggle. The team has included a screen shot of the sample dataset as well as the specific links/files where the data can be obtained.

### Project Flow Chart
This is a draft of our project's initial flow chart, including the mock up of our Machine Learning Model.

### Data Exploration
As mentioned above, our data was initially obtained from the Kaggle website. The initial dataset included over 5,000 different wines that had been tested for their various chemical components (alcohol content, acidity levels, etc.) and a quality score was generated. We took a subset of that dataset to make it more manageable and took two additional files to function as our wine sets to attempt to calculate quality scores, based on the same input values. The team used Pandas and SQL to clean the data and perform the exploratory analysis.

#### Database
PostgreSQL is the database the team used. The query schema is included with the Github repository. The screen show below shows the three tables created within the database:

This is the ERD for the Database:

#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using for training and testing our source data and to create a linear/non-linear regression model. 

## Dashboard
For our dashboard, weâ€™ll utilize Tableau to build a fully functioning, interactive dashboard. 

# Outline of Final Dashboard
We plan to build our dashboard within Tableau and anticipate it will include the following elements:

- Bar chart to display the top quality score wines.
- Column chart to compare wine quality scores.
- Pie chart to display the percentages of the categories, such as alcohol content, residual sugar, etc. of the wines with the highest quality scores and how they are distributed.
- The average quality score for our wine.

This is our initial outline of our dashboard and will progressively elaborate as we analyze our data and outcomes of our analysis.

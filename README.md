# Final Project: Predicting Wine Quality
Predicting Wine Quality was selected to determine if a vineyard that is interested in a new business venture in the wine industry would be successful, based upon characteristics their wine possesses.

## Outline of Project

### Communication Protocols
We established that our group will communicate via class times, Slack, text, and ad hoc phone and video calls.

### Overview of Project
Our project is titled, "Predicting Wine Quality." was selected to determine if a vineyard that is interested in a new business venture in the wine industry would be successful, based upon characteristics their wine possesses.

## Questions the data will potentially answer using Machine Learning:
- Will the wine produced at the vineyard have high quality scores and be successful?
- If wine characteristics are altered, will this impact the algorithm and not produce target quality scores?


# Technology

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and SQL will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask or Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using for training and testing our source data and to create a linear/non-linear regression model. 

## Dashboard
For our dashboard, weâ€™ll utilize Tableau to build a fully functioning, interactive dashboard.

# Outline of Final Dashboard
We plan to build our dashboard within Tableau and anticipate it will include the following elements:

- Bar chart to display the top quality score wines.
- Column chart to compare wine quality scores.
- Pie chart to display the percentages of the categories, such as alcohol content, residual sugar, etc. of the wines with the highest quality scores and how they are distributed.
- The average quality score for our wine.

This is our initial outline of our dashboard and will progressively elaborate as we analyze our data and outcomes of our analysis.
